# hybrid-search-pgvector
This repository demonstrates how to implement hybrid search using pgvector, an extension for PostgreSQL that enables vector similarity search. It combines semantic search (using embeddings) with traditional keyword-based search to improve retrieval accuracy.
Task Chosen: Hybrid Search in PGVector
Objective: Build a hybrid search application using PGVector, compare dense vs. dense+sparse search strategies, and present the results via a frontend.
Tools: PostgreSQL with PGVector, Supabase (optional hosting), Python (backend), Athina (LLM judge), FinanceBench dataset, React (frontend).
Deliverables: GitHub repo, code walkthrough video, functional app, and analysis.
